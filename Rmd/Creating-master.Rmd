```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
    prim_master <- read_csv("../data/20180522-master-all-crabs-hemo-mod3.csv")
```

```{r}
prim_master
```

```{r} 
df <- prim_master %>% 
  group_by(FRP) %>% 
  mutate(grouped_id = row_number())
df
```

```{r}
dfhack <- df %>% 
  spread(grouped_id, tube_no)
```

```{r}
dfhack
```

```{r}
write_csv(dfhack, "../analyses/dfhack.csv")

```



```{r}
dfhack2
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
prim_master_00 <- filter(dfhack2, tube12 != ".")
prim_master_00
write.csv(prim_master_00, "../analyses/prim_master_00.csv")
```

load("../an")
```{r}
prim_master <- read_csv("../analyses/prim_master_00.csv")
```
