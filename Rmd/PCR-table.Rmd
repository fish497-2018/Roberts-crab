Here I will attempt to get the PCR Data in order...

>You can easily add the dates. Any crab with a 37- or 38- prefix in the sample no. was from Day 26 -- those also have tube #s, cuz the aliquots (DNA in RNAlater) came from you. All the crabs with 30- thru 34- were sampled on day 0/1. Make sense?

File: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertsLab/project-crab/master/data/20180522-master-qPCR-all-runs.csv




```{r warning=FALSE}
first_pcr <- read_csv("../data/20180522-master-qPCR-all-runs.csv")
```

```{r}
first_pcr
```



```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
mutate(first_pcr, sampleday = ifelse(Sample_pre == 37 | Sample_pre == 38, "day26", ifelse(Sample_pre == 30 | Sample_pre == 31 | Sample_pre == 32 | Sample_pre == 33 | Sample_pre == 34, "day01", "unknown")))
```
